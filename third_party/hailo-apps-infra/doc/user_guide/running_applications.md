These standalone applications typically require additional dependencies which can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file in each application's directory.

## How to Run Pipeline Applications

Pipeline applications can be run using their CLI command. For example, to start the simple object detection:

```bash
hailo-detect-simple
```
To close any application, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

### Selecting an Input Source

By default, applications may use a pre-packaged video file. You can specify a different input source using the `--input` (or `-i`) flag.

**Run with a Raspberry Pi Camera:**
```bash
hailo-detect --input rpi
```

**Run with a USB Camera (Webcam):**
This command will automatically find and use the first available USB camera.
```bash
hailo-detect --input usb
```

**Run with a specific camera device:**
First, find your camera's device path. You can use a command like `ls /dev/video*` or our provided script:
```bash
get-usb-camera
```
Then, use the device path as the input:
```bash
hailo-detect --input /dev/video0
```

**Run with a video file:**
```bash
hailo-detect --input your_video.mp4
```

**Run with an RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol):**
```bash
hailo-detect --input rtsp://username:password@ip_address:port/path
```

## Customizing with Command-Line Arguments

While the applications run out-of-the-box, you can customize their behavior using command-line arguments.

For a quick list of all options for any command, use the `--help` flag:
```bash
hailo-detect --help
```

All applications share a common set of arguments for controlling the input source, hardware, performance, and display settings.

## How to Run Standalone Applications

Standalone applications are Python scripts located in `hailo_apps/python/standalone_apps/`. Each application has its own README file with specific instructions.

**General steps to run a standalone application:**

1. Navigate to the application directory:
```bash
cd hailo_apps/python/standalone_apps/<application_name>/
```

2. Install application-specific dependencies (if a `requirements.txt` exists):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python <application_name>.py [arguments]
```

**Example - Running the Voice Assistant:**
```bash
cd hailo_apps/python/gen_ai_apps/voice_assistant/
python voice_assistant.py
```

Refer to each application's README for detailed usage instructions, configuration options, and specific requirements.

## Command-Line Argument Reference (Pipeline Applications)

| Flag(s)                  | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--input, -i <source>`   | Specifies the input source. Common options include: `rpi`, `usb`, a device path like `/dev/video0`, or a path to a video file.                |
| `--arch <architecture>`  | Manually sets the Hailo device architecture (e.g., `hailo8`, `hailo8l`, `hailo10h`). If not provided, the system will auto-detect the device. |
| `--hef-path <path>`      | Path to a custom compiled HEF model file, allowing you to run your own trained models.                                                        |
| `--show-fps, -f`         | Displays a real-time Frames-Per-Second (FPS) counter on the output video window.                                                              |
| `--frame-rate, -r <fps>` | Sets the target input frame rate for the video source. Defaults to 30.                                                                        |
| `--disable-sync`         | Disables display synchronization to run the pipeline at maximum speed. This is ideal for benchmarking processing throughput.                  |
| `--disable-callback`     | Disables user-defined Python callback functions. Frame counting for watchdog continues. Use for performance benchmarking.                     |
| `--dump-dot`             | Generates a `pipeline.dot` file, which is a graph of the GStreamer pipeline that can be visualized with tools like Graphviz.                  |
| `--labels-json <path>`   | Path to a custom JSON file containing the labels for the classes your model can detect or classify.                                           |
| `--use-frame, -u`        | In applications with a Python callback, this flag indicates that the callback is responsible for providing the frame for display.             |
| `--enable-watchdog`      | Monitors the pipeline for stalls (no frames processed for 5s) and automatically rebuilds it. Works with --disable-callback.                   |
| `--log-level <level>`    | Set logging level: debug, info, warning, error, critical. Default: info. Can also use --debug for debug level.                                |
| `--log-file <path>`      | Optional log file path for persistent logging. Also respects $HAILO_LOG_FILE environment variable.                                            |

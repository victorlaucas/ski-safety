Super resolution 
================

This example performs super resolution using a **Hailo8**, **Hailo8L** or **Hailo10H** device.  
It receives an input image and enhances the image quality and details.

![output example](./output_example.png)

Requirements
------------

- hailo_platform:
    - 4.23.0 (for Hailo-8 devices)
    - 5.1.1 (for Hailo-10H devices)
- Pillow
- opencv-python

Supported Models
----------------

- real_esrgan_x2

## Installation and Usage

Run this app in one of two ways:
1. Standalone installation in a clean virtual environment (no TAPPAS required) — see [Option 1](#option-1-standalone-installation)
2. From an installed `hailo-apps` repository — see [Option 2](#option-2-inside-an-installed-hailo-apps-repository)

## Option 1: Standalone Installation

To avoid compatibility issues, it's recommended to use a clean virtual environment.

0. Install PyHailoRT
    - Download the HailoRT whl from the Hailo website - make sure to select the correct Python version. 
    - Install whl:
    ```shell script
    pip install hailort-X.X.X-cpXX-cpXX-linux_x86_64.whl
    ```

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell script
    git clone https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-apps.git
    cd hailo-apps/python/standalone_apps/super_resolution
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```shell script
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Option 2: Inside an Installed hailo-apps Repository
If you installed the full repository:
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-apps.git
cd hailo-apps
sudo ./install.sh
source setup_env.sh
```
Then the app is already ready for usage:
```shell script
cd hailo-apps/python/standalone_apps/super_resolution
```

## Run
After completing either installation option, run from the application folder:
```shell script
./super_resolution.py -n <model_path> -i <input_image_path> -o <output_path>
```

Arguments
---------

- `--hef-path, -n`: 
    - A **model name** (e.g., `real_esrgan_x2`) → the script will automatically download and resolve the correct HEF for your device.
    - A **file path** to a local HEF → the script will use the specified network directly.
- `-i, --input`:
  - An **input source** such as an image (`bus.jpg`), a video (`video.mp4`), a directory of images, or `usb` to use the system camera.
    - On Raspberry Pi, you can also use `rpi` to enable the Raspberry Pi camera.
  - A **predefined input name** from `resources_config.yaml` (e.g., `bus`, `street`).
    - If you choose a predefined name, the input will be **automatically downloaded** if it doesn't already exist.
  - Use `--list-inputs` to display all available predefined inputs.
- `-b, --batch-size`: [optional] Number of images in one batch. Defaults to 1.
- `-s, --save-output`: [optional] Save the output of the inference from a stream.
- `-o, --output-dir`: [optional] Directory where output images/videos will be saved.
- `cr, --camera-resolution`: [optional][Camera only] Input resolution: `sd` (640x480), `hd` (1280x720), or `fhd` (1920x1080).
- `or, --output-resolution`: [optional] Set output size using `sd|hd|fhd`, or pass custom width/height (e.g., `--output-resolution 1920 1080`).
- `--show-fps`: [optional] Display FPS performance metrics for video/camera input.
- `-f, --frame-rate`: [optional][Camera only] Override the camera input framerate.
- `--list-models`: [optional] Print all supported models for this application (from `resources_config.yaml`) and exit.
- `--list-inputs`: [optional] Print the available predefined input resources (images/videos) defined in `resources_config.yaml` for this application, then exit.



### Environment Variables
- `CAMERA_INDEX`: [Camera input only] Select which usb camera index to use when -i camera is specified. Defaults to 0 if not set.
    - Example: `CAMERA_INDEX=1 ./super_resolution.py -n model.hef -i usb`


For more information:
```shell script
./super_resolution.py -h
```
Example 
-------

**List supported networks**
```shell script
./super_resolution.py --list-nets
```

**List available input resources**
```shell script
./super_resolution.py --list-inputs
```

**Inference on single image**
```shell script
./super_resolution.py -n ./real_esrgan_x2.hef -i input_image.png
```

**Inference on a usb camera stream**
```shell script
./super_resolution.py -n ./real_esrgan_x2.hef -i usb
```


**Inference on a usb camera stream with custom frame rate**
```shell script
./super_resolution.py -n ./real_esrgan_x2.hef -i usb -f 1
```


Additional Notes
----------------
- The script assumes that the image is in one of the following formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png or .bmp
